# HW.template
Template for KiCAD PCB projects

## How to name your project
**The kicad project name should be the name of the repo without the "-HW" part. For example EBS-HW repo should contain EBS.pro KiCAD project.**

The KiCAD project should be in the top level folder of the repo, i.e. no additional folders containing the KiCAD project should be there. To achieve that you will need to unselect an option when creating the project
